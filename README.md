# My personal Emacs configuration

Compatibility: GNU/Emacs 25.X and 26.X, primarily for Linux env.

Uses `use-package`, the Emacs package framework and avoids the customize 
facility, preferring to hand code all preferences in `init.el`. The config boot 
straps Emacs by automatically downloading missing packages from repositories.

Some reusable library code may be found under the `el` subdirectory of this 
repository.
